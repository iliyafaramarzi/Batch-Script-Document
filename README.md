# What is this?
This is a batch script document that helps you learn batch script as fast as possible. You can find useful and important commands for batch script here.

# How to Start?
Just read it.


# Prerequisite concepts
If you want to really learn batch fast, you can skip these sections, but I recommend reading them.

### Enviroment variables
Environment variables are user-defined values that can store some data for programs to access. For example, if a program needs to run Python, it can easily find a Python path from environment variables and run it. An environment variable has a name that you (and your program) can access by its name and a value. The value of a variable can be a string, an integer, a file path, a list, or a boolean.

### How my computer works?
Every click that you make in your Windows has a command prompt, and this is exactly how OS works. When you move a file, the OS runs a command to do this and show it on display. You can do it by yourself, and this is actually what cmd is.
When you use a command in the command prompt, the command will be passed to OS, and OS will tell your command to your hardware and do what you want.

### Do you need to know programming?
Batch script is not a programming language and it is an interpreter-based scripting language. It includes some fundamental parts of a programming language, such as if, else if, while, etc., but you can't program an application with it. So if you are a programmer and know some programming languages, you can easily learn them, but if you are not, don't worry; everything is easy here; just don't stop learning.

# Let's start
## Run program
Batch script files has .bat extention and you can them in cmd with `name.bat [arg]` command in cmd. (you have to change your directory to file directory using `cd` command)

## Print(echo)
you can dispaly anything on display with `echo` command. Now you can write `echo Hello World` and run it like what did i say and boom you write your first batch script program.

### What is `@echo off`
If you don't use `@echo off` command in your project you can see that when you run your program it will enter some prompt and show output but when you use `@echo off` every command that you use will be run at background and you can just see the output.
you can also restore it to defualt with using `@echo on` command.

### What is @?
@ means this is not a echo command and don't display anything on screen from this line.

### All formats of echo
- echo [on / off] --> to set command-line setting
- echo [message] --> Print meesage
- echo.[message] --> Print meesage
- echo/[message] --> Print meesage
- echo --> show current setting of the commandline
- echo /? --> Show for 'echo' command
